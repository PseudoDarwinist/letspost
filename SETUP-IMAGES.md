# Setting Up Your Background Images

## Step 1: Save the Two Backgrounds

You have two beautiful backgrounds ready to use!

### **Background 1 - Retro Waves (Warm)**
- The one with orange/coral curved waves
- **Save as:** `images/background-001.jpg`

### **Background 2 - Cyberpunk City (Cool)**
- The one with teal city lights at night
- **Save as:** `images/background-002.jpg`

## Step 2: How to Save

1. Right-click on each image in the chat
2. Select "Save Image As..."
3. Navigate to: `/Users/chetansingh/Documents/Agents/LetsPost/images/`
4. Save with the names above

## Step 3: Use in Your Posts

When running `python create-post.py`, when it asks:
```
Background image filename (in images/ folder):
```

Type one of these:
- `background-001.jpg` (for retro waves)
- `background-002.jpg` (for cyberpunk city)

## Alternative: Drag & Drop

You can also:
1. Open Finder and go to your project folder
2. Navigate to the `images/` folder
3. Drag and drop the images there
4. Rename them to `background-001.jpg` and `background-002.jpg`
