# Creating engaging AI use case threads (2025-10-18 02:23Z)

_**User (2025-10-18 02:24Z)**_

I am using Perplexity's comet AI browser, and what it does for me is it creates a task every day at 7:00 AM in an instant time, and it creates a list of all 5-10 use cases from YouTube videos where there is an actual hands-on work or actual hands-on solving of real-world problems through LLM and AI agents in diverse industries. I read them; I am actually very interested in use cases of this problem-solving through AI and LLM and building LLM native applications. But I want to take these use cases and post it on Twitter and LinkedIn so that I share my learning, I build it live. So I want to create and use Claude Code or I want to use something that can help me take this list of use cases that Comet has given me and create a descriptive thread or post of these use cases. I want to first tell the problem statement what I am trying to solve, then I want to draw the system architecture, and then give the logical steps of building that use case all through examples and metaphors. I want to use the real-world examples of apps people use because that will help them understand the concept I am trying to solve. Let's say if I am building a rag, I can tell how Spotify will be able to use this feature and they will build it because since they use these apps and things daily, they will connect automatically (metaphor of football, metaphor of music). They will connect instantly, and then take this buildable, actionable thread where people can read and actually build something and post it. How do I achieve this?

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Clarifying user workflow**

The user is describing a workflow involving Perplexity's Comet AI browser to create daily task lists of 5-10 use cases from YouTube videos. They want to convert these into Twitter and LinkedIn posts or threads that include a problem statement, system architecture diagrams, and logical steps for building the use case, complete with real-world app references. I need to ask 1-2 critical questions if needed before creating a plan using the appropriate function once I have enough information.
**Proposing a structured workflow**

I need to outline a workflow that automates tasks like fetching Comet tasks, parsing the list, and researching each use case. The goal is to generate structured content and create diagrams using tools like Mermaid or Excalidraw. I'll also develop social media variants for Twitter and LinkedIn, including examples and metaphors. While the system reminds me to avoid edits, I can utilize read-only tools to ensure I gather accurate information without altering any configurations or making changes.
**Planning the workflow**

I understand that web searches are read-only and that I can perform them to gather relevant information without making changes. The user wants specific usage cases without hallucinating details, so I need to keep that in mind. Since the question is about how to achieve their goals, it leans more towards providing a planning or architectural response. I'll take care to cite any pertinent information from memory when applicable to maintain accuracy.
**Crafting an automation plan**

I’m thinking about creating a plan for an automation pipeline. The inputs would include daily tasks from Comet, possibly sourced from email or a workspace. For ingestion, I could use Comet's API or browser automation to extract the list, watch Gmail labels, or export to Notion or Google Sheets.

Next, for research, the YouTube Data API might help fetch video transcripts. I'll summarize these transcripts and extract relevant information.

Content generation would involve using templated prompts to produce a problem statement, system diagram, step-by-step build with code examples, and analogies like “How Spotify or Amazon could utilize this.” For visuals, I’ll recommend using tools like Mermaid for diagrams.
**Preparing critical questions**

I’m focusing on gathering essential details for creating the plan. First, I need to ask how the user receives the daily Comet list. Here’s how I’ll format my questions:

1. How do you receive the daily Comet list?
   - a) Gmail email
   - b) API/export/URL
   - c) Manual paste into a file/Notion
   - d) Other (please specify)

2. What is your posting workflow preference?
   - a) Fully automated publish via Buffer/Hypefury to X and LinkedIn
   - b) Generate drafts + images for manual review/scheduling 
   - c) Export to Notion/Google Docs for editing, then manual posting

I’m going to wait for their responses before proceeding with the plan!
**Finalizing the approach**

I’ll start by acknowledging the situation and summarizing our plan. I’ll mention that we’ll set up a pipeline to ingest the Comet list, ground it with video transcripts, generate architecture diagrams and thread drafts, add analogies, and output the Twitter thread and LinkedIn post, with scheduling as an option. 

Then, I’ll ask the two critical questions without any heavy formatting:

"I’ll clarify two inputs to tailor the plan. Here are my questions: 
1. How do you receive the daily Comet list?
    - a) Gmail email
    - b) API/export/URL
    - c) Manual paste into a file/Notion
    - d) Other (please specify)
2. What is your posting workflow preference?
    - a) Fully automated publish via Buffer/Hypefury
    - b) Generate drafts for manual review/scheduling
    - c) Export to Notion/Google Docs for editing, then post manually." 

I won’t create any to-do lists or plans until I get their answers.</details></think>

I’ll tailor a concrete, end-to-end automation plan, but first I need two quick inputs.

1. How do you currently receive the daily Comet list?
   - a) Email in Gmail
   - b) Shareable link/API/export from Perplexity
   - c) Manual paste into Notion/Google Doc/file
   - d) Other (please specify)

2. How do you want posting to work?
   - a) Fully automated publish to X and LinkedIn (via Buffer/Hypefury)
   - b) Generate drafts + images for my review, then I click to schedule
   - c) Export drafts to Notion/Docs for editing, then manual posting

If you don’t choose, I’ll assume: a) Gmail ingestion and b) generate drafts for your review, implemented in Python with Claude (Anthropic).

First, I receive it as an email in my Gmail, and there is this little button in that email where I can review it. When I click it, it opens the Perplexity document that it has created. That's the medium I receive it. How do I want posting to work? It has to be an export drafts to Notion or Doc Notion. I have a Notion business account, so I can export this to Notions and then I can review it because I want to include real-world diagrams of system architecture. It has to be a very nice system architecture which people can read, and then yeah I'll manually post it.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Exploring diagram generation options**

I’m considering reliability in generating diagrams as PNGs. I could use Mermaid CLI, Excalidraw for automated PNG export, or even the `diagrams` Python library to create architecture diagrams. Another option is Graphviz DOT or `D2` via CLI. For simplicity, Mermaid CLI might be best. I could propose using a SaaS like the Kroki API, which allows for easier generation of diagrams from Mermaid via HTTP. This lets me upload images to Notion while ensuring privacy.
**Planning email workflow**

I’m crafting a workflow to trigger daily at 7:05 AM or upon receiving a specific Gmail label, "Perplexity Comet Daily Use Cases." I’ll use the Gmail API to watch for this email and parse its content. Since clicking a review link may not work, I’ll extract the link from the email HTML and check if it leads to an accessible Perplexity document. If authentication is needed, I'll plan to fetch content via HTTP. As a backup, I’ll use Playwright for scraping while retaining login.
**Planning Perplexity document workflow**

First, I need to determine if the Perplexity document is public, but I should prepare for both public and private options.

I plan to extract Use Cases by parsing the document for the top 5-10 items, including the title, video URL, and summary — maybe with the help of an LLM to streamline the process.

For each use case, I’ll research context, fetch transcripts, summarize challenges, and produce structured content with architecture proposals and examples.

I'll use Claude 3.5 Sonnet for content generation, employing structured prompts and metaphors while preparing a diagram with Mermaid and Kroki for PNG output. Finally, I’ll use the Notion API to create a database for "AI Use Case Threads."
**Outlining page structure and workflow**

Each page I create will include several properties, such as Date, Status (Draft), Platforms (X, LinkedIn), Tags, and Source Links, plus child blocks for title and sections. I plan to embed images and export X threads as numbered tweets and LinkedIn posts.

For safety and quality, I need to ensure deduplication of use cases, track posted history, and maintain disclaimers in examples. After creation in Notion, I’ll notify via email or Slack, potentially generating short and long versions. 

I’ll implement this as a Python project with various integrations, but I’ll also pay attention to length limits for LinkedIn and Twitter. Scheduling tasks could involve GitHub Actions or manual runs since automation isn’t explicitly requested.</details></think>
